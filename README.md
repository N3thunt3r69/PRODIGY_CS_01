# PRODIGY_CS_01
Repository created for my first task I have to complete for my internship with Prodigy Infotech.
This program written in python implements a basic Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption using Tkinter for it's graphical user interface. The user can input a message and a shift value, and choose to either encrypt or decrypt the message. The result is displayed in the GUI. The `caesar_cipher_N3thunt3r69` function performs the encryption and decryption of the message.
